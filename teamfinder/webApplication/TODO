Part 9: SPA

get old dal to work

leave group

"created at" i group-specific funkar inte. Fixa datumet?

better validation on create account

we can create a group, which we cant join because of the requirements => a group gets created without any member/admin

name of group has to be unique, this throws a database error and doesnt show validation error to the user.
